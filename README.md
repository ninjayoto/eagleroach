Eagleroach is a **self-hosted software** and it helps you to
- View PDFs in a nice interface.
- Organize your PDFs into multiple directories (in other words a **file tree**) structure.
- Collaborate with our annotation tools with other users in the platform.
- Full-text search PDFs title, author and **it's content as well**.
- Keep your PDFs private or public or share only with selected users.
- Last but not least - Fine-grained user experience.
